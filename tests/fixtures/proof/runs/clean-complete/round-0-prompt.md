## Goal Tracker Setup (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

Before starting implementation, you MUST initialize the Goal Tracker:

1. Read @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/rlcr/2026-07-30_04-22-19/goal-tracker.md
2. If the "Ultimate Goal" section says "[To be extracted...]", extract a clear goal statement from the plan
3. If the "Acceptance Criteria" section says "[To be defined...]", define 3-7 specific, testable criteria
4. Populate the "Active Tasks" table with MAINLINE tasks from the plan, mapping each to an AC and filling Tag/Owner
5. Record any already-known side issues in either "Blocking Side Issues" or "Queued Side Issues"
6. Write the updated goal-tracker.md

## Round Contract Setup (REQUIRED BEFORE CODING)

Before starting implementation, create @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/rlcr/2026-07-30_04-22-19/round-0-contract.md with:

1. **One mainline objective** for this round
2. **Target ACs** (1-2 ACs only)
3. **Blocking side issues in scope** for this round
4. **Queued side issues out of scope** for this round
5. **Round success criteria**

Use this contract to keep the round focused. Do NOT let non-blocking bugs or cleanup work replace the mainline objective.

**IMPORTANT**: The IMMUTABLE SECTION can only be modified in Round 0. After this round, it becomes read-only.

## Implementation Plan

For all tasks that need to be completed, please use the Task system (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList).

Every task MUST start with exactly one lane tag:
- `[mainline]` for plan-derived work that directly advances the round objective
- `[blocking]` for issues that prevent the mainline objective from succeeding safely
- `[queued]` for non-blocking bugs, cleanup, or follow-up work

Rules:
- `[mainline]` tasks are the primary success condition for the round
- `[blocking]` tasks may be resolved in the round only if they truly block mainline progress
- `[queued]` tasks must NOT become the round objective and do NOT need to be cleared before moving on
- If a new issue is not blocking the current objective, tag it `[queued]` and keep moving on the mainline

## Task Tag Routing (MUST FOLLOW)

Each task must have one routing tag from the plan: `coding` or `analyze`.

- Tag `coding`: Claude executes the task directly.
- Tag `analyze`: Claude must execute via `/rloop:ask-codex`, then integrate Codex output.
- Keep Goal Tracker "Active Tasks" columns **Tag** and **Owner** aligned with execution (`coding -> claude`, `analyze -> codex`).
- If a task has no explicit tag, default to `coding` (Claude executes directly).

# Add a deterministic greeting

## Goal

Add a tiny Python greeting module with one independently verifiable behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `greeting.py` exports `greeting()` and it returns exactly `"hello"`.
- `test_greeting.py` verifies the public function through `unittest`.
- The implementation and test are committed before review.

## Constraints

- Use only the Python standard library.
- Keep the change limited to the greeting module and its test.

## BitLesson Selection (REQUIRED FOR EACH TASK)

Before executing each task or sub-task, you MUST:

1. Read @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/bitlesson.md
2. Run `bitlesson-selector` for each task/sub-task to select relevant lesson IDs
3. Follow the selected lesson IDs (or `NONE`) during implementation

Include a `## BitLesson Delta` section in your summary with:
- Action: none|add|update
- Lesson ID(s): NONE or comma-separated IDs
- Notes: what changed and why (required if action is add or update)

Reference: @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/bitlesson.md

## Goal Tracker Rules

Throughout your work, you MUST maintain the Goal Tracker:

1. **Before starting a round**: Re-anchor on the original plan and current round contract
2. **Before starting a task**: Mark the relevant mainline task as "in_progress" in Active Tasks
   - Confirm Tag/Owner routing is correct before execution
3. **Active Tasks** are MAINLINE tasks only - side issues do not belong there
4. **Blocking Side Issues** are reserved for issues that truly stop mainline progress
5. **Queued Side Issues** are non-blocking and must not take over the round
6. **After completing a mainline task**: Move it to "Completed and Verified" with evidence (but mark as "pending verification")
7. **If you discover the plan has errors**:
   - Do NOT silently change direction
   - Add entry to "Plan Evolution Log" with justification
   - Explain how the change still serves the Ultimate Goal
8. **If you need to defer a task**:
   - Move it to "Explicitly Deferred" section
   - Provide strong justification
   - Explain impact on Acceptance Criteria
9. **If you discover new issues**:
   - Add to "Blocking Side Issues" only if mainline progress is blocked
   - Otherwise add to "Queued Side Issues" or keep them as `[queued]` tasks/backlog

Note: You MUST NOT try to exit `start-rlcr-loop` loop by lying or edit loop state file or try to execute `cancel-rlcr-loop`

After completing the work, please:
0. If you have access to the `code-simplifier` agent, use it to review and optimize the code you just wrote
1. Finalize @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/rlcr/2026-07-30_04-22-19/goal-tracker.md (this is Round 0, so you are initializing it - see "Goal Tracker Setup" above)
2. Write your round contract into @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/rlcr/2026-07-30_04-22-19/round-0-contract.md
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
4. Write your work summary into @/Users/quiz/conductor/workspaces/loop/philadelphia/.context/fixture-runs/clean-complete-v2/.loop/rlcr/2026-07-30_04-22-19/round-0-summary.md
