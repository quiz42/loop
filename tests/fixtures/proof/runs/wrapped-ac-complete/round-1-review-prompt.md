# Code Review Phase - Round 1

This file documents the code review invocation for audit purposes.
Note: `codex review` does not accept prompt input; it performs automated code review based on git diff.

## Review Configuration

- **Base Branch**: master
- **Review Round**: 1
- **Timestamp**: 2026-08-07T16:22:57Z

## What This Phase Does

1. Runs `codex review --base master` to perform automated code review
2. Scans output for `[P0-9]` severity markers indicating issues
3. If issues found: Returns fix prompt to Claude for remediation
4. If no issues: Transitions to Finalize Phase

## Expected Output Format

Codex review outputs issues in this format:
```
- [P0] Critical issue description - /path/to/file.py:line-range
  Detailed explanation of the issue.

- [P1] High priority issue - /path/to/file.py:line-range
  Detailed explanation.
```
